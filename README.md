Cengify is a rising audio streaming platform founded on 20 November 2022 by a student
in Middle East Technical University. Platform is rapidly growing. Now, it already reaches
several thousands users per day and you as a platform owner realized that the system does

In the assignment, you should store the music records by using both primary and secondary B+ Trees. You will implement only certain operations described below. Also, it
is provided a nice graphical user interface such that you can check the correctness of your
implementation.
